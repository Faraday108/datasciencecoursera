What you'd desire is a nice format like an excel spreadsheet. 
More commonly will get not nice data that requires parsing.  
Can also get data in other formats like JSON. JSON is easy to send, but not to analyze.

Might need to extract from databases such as mySQL, MongoDB.  
Might be stored online or on computer such as on twitter API.
